# React

- works with modules that encapsulate certain functionality
- react-bot creates virtual DOM to manipulate it
- has a huge ecosystem (due to popularity)

## How-to

- main functionality encapsuladed in `src/App.js`
- rendered in `src/index.js` which graps the `root` tag from the `public/index.html`
- allows its own CSS file per file

## Classes vs. Hooks

- hooks are fairly new, add complexity, are React-specific
